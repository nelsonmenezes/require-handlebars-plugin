<!-- Just some notes, nothing important to the demo. -->

Note 1: if this page isn't working for you, you probably need to run the build.<br />
Make sure you have node.js installed and then run this in the base directory:<br /><br />
<code>node r.js -o demo/app.build.js</code>
</p>

Note 2: Generally you won't have 2 different html files for the build and dev modes. Normally you'd just serve the built directory on production where the non-build directory is on your dev server. So your template never have to change, just your static directory switched out.
